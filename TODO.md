# TODO: Update Orders Page to Show Event-Specific Info

- [x] Update `lib/actions/registration.actions.ts`: Modify `getAllRegistrations` to populate 'subevents' in the event field.
- [x] Update `app/(root)/orders/page.tsx`: Modify rendering logic to group registrations by subevent and display individual participant info for individual subevents or team info for team subevents.
